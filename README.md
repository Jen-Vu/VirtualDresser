# VirtualDresser

Run project using - python Front.py
Project uses gluoncv and mxnet so u will have to install them
... and lots of other dependencies

Frontend is done with py tkinter

GPU based processing will be a lot faster but the used version has no proper support for gpu
So this project execution is painfully slow
