# VirtualDresser

Run project using - python Front.py<br/>
Project uses gluoncv and mxnet so u will have to install them
... and lots of other dependencies<br/>

Frontend is done with py tkinter<br/>

GPU based processing will be a lot faster but the used version has no proper support for gpu
So this project execution is painfully slow-Sample videos are actually videos<br/>
